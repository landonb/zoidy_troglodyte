# hey why not, it won't hurt, but nor will it help), you could
# use the included `mintupdate` cron job.
# - This is included (and not simply deleted) mostly for
#   illustrative purposes.

# Place the same cron job that Update Manager places when you go to its
# Preferences > Auto-upgrade [tab] > âœ“ Apply updates automatically.
