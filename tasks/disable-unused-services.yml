# (lb): Both apache2 and nginx are installed by Linux Minut 19, and they'll
# both compete for port 80, and on my machine, nginx seems to always wins.
# - We could resolve this situation in a few different ways:
#   - Ignore the problem, as it's not hurting anything (and we only needed
#     the web server when we first stood up the machine, to install the SSH
#     key, so that Anisble could run);
#   - Edit nginx and/or apache config files to choose different port numbers;
#   - Stop nginx and/or apache services, as it's not like I use either one.
# I'm opting for the last option -- disable services you do not use!
