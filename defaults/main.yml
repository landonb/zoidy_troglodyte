  # BEWARE: (lb): I wonder if someone could name a machine "192.168.11",
  # so that it reports as "192.168.11.lan", thereby deceiving our check!
  # However, the alert-ssh-login feature is for the super-paranoid (me!)
  # and it's super unlikely anyone will have stolen your SSH keys, or that
  # you've misconfigured SSH and allowed another attack vector, so I'm not
  # going to worry about this any further. Just a note that I'm aware of the
  # glaring security hole with regex matching here.
